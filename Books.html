The Crown of Glass
</p>
<p class='Special3'>
A dystopian world, with a crown of glass. Cities protected by bubbles, deserts populated by slaves, oceans filled with inventors, and forests full of hunters and prey. James is the son of one of the most powerful people in the world, and is in line to inherit that power...but wants anything but. The choosing ceremony is coming up, and what he wants most is what others fear, the mystery of the forest.
